    <p>Easy omelette recipe that makes the perfect breakfast!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly gound black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 a tablespoon olive oil, butter, or bacon grease</li>
        <li>optional: add a couple tablespoons of your favorite veggies, meat, or cheese!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk the eggs, salt, and pepper together until lightly frothy.</li>
        <li>In an 8-inch non-stick pan, heat the oil over medium-low heat. Pour in the eggs and tilt the pan to make sure they're evenly spread out, then turn the heat down to low. Cook the omelette for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the edges are cooked through and the top is slightly wet but not runny.</li>
        <li>If you'd like to add filling, add it to half of the omelette. Then use a patula to fold the empty half on top and slide the omelette onto a plate. Garnish with chopped herbs.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>That's it! Enjoy!</h3>
