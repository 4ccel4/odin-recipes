      <p>Chocolate chip cookies are easy to bake and delicious</p>
      <p>This recipe can be made from scratch in less than 20 minutes</p>
      <p>You'll need a <strong>whisk</strong> for mixing, a <strong>spatula</strong>, <strong>baking sheet</strong>, <strong>large bowl</strong> and something to meaure ingredients.</p>,

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F.</li>
       <li>Microwave the butter for about 40 seconds. Butter should be completely melted but shouldn't be hot.</li>
       <li>In a large bowl, mix butter with sugars until well-combined.</li>
       <li>stir in vanilla and egg until incorporated.</li>
       <li>Add the flour, baking soda, and salt. Be sure that the flour is loose in the measuring cup as packing it in could lead to adding more than desired.</li>
       <li>Mix dough until just combined. Dough should be soft and a little sticky but not overly sticky.</li> 
       <li>Stir in chocolate chips.</li>
       <li>Scoop out 1.5 tablespoons of dough and place 2 inches apart on your baking sheet.</li>
       <li>Bake for 7-10 minutes, or until cookies are set. They will be puffy and still look a little underbaked in the middle.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>You're done!</h2>
        <p>Now just let your cookies cool down and enjoy!</p>
